*Use JavaScript/Node.js and the Alexa Skills Kit to create a skill

*Get a skill published - Test the skill and send it through the certification process, making it available to be enabled by any Alexa user.

## The Inspiration

Funny story... I needed to study for my learner's permit exam and needed someone to quiz me at a moment's notice. I knew about the Amazon echo dot and thought it would be a great study buddy for anyone who coudldn't wrangle a friend or sibling at 3AM(guilty...) the morning before the exam. Studying for the exam while programming the Alexa skill forced me to know the correct answer 100% so that Alexa would always know the right answer. Multi-tasking FTW!
